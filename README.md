# Supplemental Rationale


## Introduction

[*New Concept English*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Concept_English) by L. G. Alexander is a popular English language textbook teaching British rules of English. The course was first published on October 30, 1967. A later (1993) revised edition is also available. 

[This project](https://codepen.io/xs2343/pen/RzxqaZ) selected the first lesson in *New Concept English 4*, including **audio**, **text**, **vocabulary** and **exercises**. It is designed as a supplementary material for teachers to teach, and students can also self-learn through this project.


## Notes
### Audio
Before reading the article, the teacher may ask the students to listen to the audio and answer the question. The audio should be played first. When the audio is ended, the question will appear on the page. This is a good exercise for students to improve their listening skills. If the students miss something, the audio can be played repeatedly. Students may also practice their speaking skills by reading after the audio. After listening to the audio, the student can move on by clicking on the hyperlink.

### Text
In the text section, when a student selects a piece of text, the text will be bolded so that the student can mark the key sentences when learning the text.

### New words and expressions
This section lists the key words and expressions in this lesson. Students can find the Chinese interpretation of each word by clicking on it. Since the Chinese interpretation only appears when the word is clicked, this design also enables students to self-test whether they have understood the words.

### Questions
After completing the study, the teacher may ask the students to complete these questions so as to test their learning results. These questions are all multiple-choice questions. Students will be tested for their mastery of grammar and vocabulary, as well as their reading comprehension. Their total score and the key to the questions will be shown after they click on the "Submit" button. Teachers may teach in a targeted manner according to each student's performance in these questions.
